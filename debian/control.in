Description: Simple tile map
 Maep is a tile based map utility for services like openstreetmap, google maps
 and virtual earth. This is the same map renderer that's also being used by
 GPXView and OSM2Go. Maep is meant to easily be included into other programs
 and to become a universal map widget for the Maemo5 platform.
